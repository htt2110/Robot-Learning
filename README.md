# Robot-Learning

This directory consists of my solutions for the Robot Learning course offered at Columbia University. I took this course in the Spring 2021 semester. 

The assignments cover the concepts of Neural Networks and their application in Robotic environment. 

The types of DL covered in this course are:
1. Deep Neural Network (DNN)
2. Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
3. Deep Q Network (part of Reinforcement Learning)
